    <h2>Experience CU</h2>
    <p>
        The day begins with the chirping of birds, many of which are unique to this region. Exotic animals, such as Hilly ‘Maya’ deer, porcupine, squirrel, python, water monitor and different reptiles and snakes roam around the hilly jungle under broad daylight. When the darkness of night falls, wild foxes start howling, while nocturnal wild boars and pole-cats come out from their den to hunt. This is not a description of a safari park in Bangladesh. This is just a glance of the magnificent biodiversity that can be found in the University of Chittagong campus. The university has the second largest campus in the country, with over 1,700 acres of hilly and plain lands. The rows of trees alongside the hilly roads present a beautiful spectacle for the eyes, and the hilly streams soothe the tired visitors. There something for every everyone here, be it rows of hilly areas or the sunrise and sunset from the mountain peak. The ever-prevalent biodiversity and the scenic natural beauty attracts nature lovers and tourists seeking a taste of the remarkable campus tourism.
